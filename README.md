*"Steganography Project"*
Introduction
Steganography is the practice of hiding information within another medium to prevent detection.
The word originates from Greek — "stegano" meaning hidden, and "graphy" meaning writing.

In this project, we hide secret information inside various types of media such as:

Images (e.g., .png, .bmp)

GIFs

Videos

Audio files (e.g., .mp3)

The goal is to embed data in such a way that the existence of the information is concealed — making it invisible to unauthorized users.

Features
Encode (hide) secret text messages inside media files.

Decode (extract) hidden messages from the media.

Supports multiple media formats depending on the implementation.

Simple and interactive interface (command line or GUI-based)
